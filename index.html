            It is hard for scientists to define death as a clinical state but it
            is even harder to find out what happens just before and just after
            you die. People who have lived a near-death experience (NDE) all
            tell of some similar feelings but… Is it possible we are influenced
            by our culture? Can death be reversed? How does the body react to
            death?

          <h2 class="faq-item-title">Why do we sneeze?</h2>

          <input class="faq-item-btn" type="checkbox" />

          <p class="faq-item-answer">
            Abdominal, pectoral, tracheal and facial muscles, in addition to our
            lungs, diaphragm, vocal cords and eyelids are some of the parts of
            our body involved in expelling air and mucus at around 150 km/h.
            But, what is the neurological origin of sneezing? What stimuli does
            it react to? Can you sneeze with your eyes open?

          <h2 class="faq-item-title">Can everything be bought for money?</h2>

          <input class="faq-item-btn" type="checkbox" />

          <p class="faq-item-answer">
            Money provides a certain level of living in consumption and
            existential terms. <br />
            Money allows you to undertake investment projects, organize business
            operations. <br />
            However, not everything can be bought with money. However, money
            does not ensure happiness, not everything can be bought.

            Why do we need to wait so long to see a solar eclipse?
          </h2>

          <input class="faq-item-btn" type="checkbox" />

          <p class="faq-item-answer">
            It has been calculated that for a total solar eclipse to happen
            twice in the same place, you would have to wait around 375 years. As
            such, we are lucky if we see one in our lifetimes (as long as we
            don’t move).
